# PiMachine

Uses the [Chudnovky algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm) to calculate n digits of pi. Already much less fun to optimize than the prime sieve.

Requirements: [The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library](https://gmplib.org/) (GMP)

For Debian-based distros: `libgmp-dev`

For RedHat-based distros: `gmp-devel`
